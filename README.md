### Description
This is my most recent project! I have created an original design inspired by the Weenie Hut and Salty Spittoon from everyone's favorite Nickelodeon&trade; show, *SpongeBob SquarePants*. I have previously started this project in Angular and am excited to improve upon those ideas once again using React. So far, React has taken a little longer than Angular out the gate(I am not using Create React App), and the components definitely feel more scattered. However, I'm loving the flexibility and ease of integration with other resources.
